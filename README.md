## Overview
This is my personal log for [Kaggle playground competition S4E7](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e8), in which I got the **28-th** place (__TOP 2%__) officially out of 2234 teams, in 13-th place (__TOP 1%__) using autogluon. 

* The goal of this competition is to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical characteristics by using binary classification.
* The main challenge was, in my personal opinion, to overcome too many missing values of the dataset.
* Note that the dataset for this competition is not uploaded. If you need, please visit [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e8/data).

I would like to express my gratitude to my teammate `Forever_YW`(Kaggle id) for his invaluable support and collaboration throughout this Kaggle competition.
